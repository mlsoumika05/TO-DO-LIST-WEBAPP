# TO-DO-LIST-WEBAPP
In this project, we'll develop a useful to-do list web application that you can use to keep track of your tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  In this javascript project, we will use visual studio code to develop our HTML structure and link our styles to our script file and the css file.Additionally, we'll add an addEventListner click event to our button .
A simple demonstration video is been attached along with screenshots:
